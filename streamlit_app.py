    # CONTEXT #
    You are creating a set of mathematics assessment items for {grade}.

    # Content Hierarchy (in order of priority):
    1. Narrative and Lesson Goals
    2. Goals
    3. Standards

    # Preliminary Steps:
    1. Review the Narrative, Lesson Goals, Goals, and Standards.
    2. Write a summary of how the Narrative and Lesson Goals drive the section’s key ideas
       and how they connect to the Goals and Standards. 
    3. From the Narrative and Lesson Goals, write a list of skills needed. 
       - Show how each skill helps learners meet the Goals and Standards.

    # Question Creation Guidelines:
    - Generate exactly 10 questions:
      - 5 Multiple Choice (MCQ) questions.
      - 5 Short Answer questions.
    - Ensure each question is solvable with the information provided.
    - Each question must reflect the Narrative and Lesson Goals first, then align with the Goals, and finally comply with the Standards.

    ## Multiple Choice Questions
    - Provide four answer options labeled A, B, C, D.
    - Each option should appear on its own line.
    
    ## Short Answer Questions
    - Require a clear step-by-step solution leading to a concise final answer.
    
    ## Visual Descriptions (if needed)
    - Place all visual descriptions in square brackets: [Visual: ...].
    - Include enough detail (coordinates, measures, etc.) so the problem is solvable.
    - Verify geometric or diagram-based details for mathematical consistency (e.g., parallel lines, angle sums, correct coordinates).
    
    # Formatting Requirements:
    1. Number each question as "Question 1:", "Question 2:", etc.
    2. Do your best to identify which of the submitted standards best aligns with the question and add this after the question number. Example, "Question 1: 8.8D"
    3. Use the following answer format for both MCQ and Short Answer:
       Answer: [Letter or numeric value] | Model Solution:
       • Step-by-step explanation
       • Final answer statement
    4. Do not include any meta-commentary or extra text beyond the 10 questions and their solutions.
    
    # Validation Checklist:
    1. Is the question solvable with the provided info?
    2. Does it reflect the Narrative and Lesson Goals first, then the Goals, then the Standards?
    3. Are visual or geometric details valid (correct angle sums, labeled measurements, etc.)?
    4. Is any diagram or measurement consistent and clearly labeled?
    5. Is there no missing or extraneous information?

    # REFERENCE FORMAT #
    Here are actual questions from the official {grade} assessment for content reference:

    {reference_text}

    # CONTENT TO ADDRESS #
    Generate questions covering:
    ***Learning Goals: {goals}
    ***Standards: {standards}
    ***Lesson Content: {lessons}
    ***Section Narrative: {narrative}

    Important: Generate all 10 questions at once. Do not include any introductory text, meta-commentary, or questions about continuing.
         
    3. Example Question Format for Multiple Choice:
       Question 1: 8.8D
       [Visual Description: Coordinate grid showing triangle ABC with vertices at (2,3), (4,8), and (6,2)]
       Triangle ABC has angle measures of 65° and 45°. What is the measure of the third angle?
       A) 60°
       B) 70°
       C) 85°
       D) 180°
       Answer: B | Model Solution:
       • Sum of angles in a triangle = 180°
       • Known angles: 65° + 45° = 110°
       • 180° - 110° = 70°
       Therefore, the third angle measures 70°
